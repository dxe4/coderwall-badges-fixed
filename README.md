coderwall-badges-fixed
=============
Refresh coder wall badges.


So coderwall badges are broken (they've been broken for a while).
If you opt-out and opt-in again, it adds the new badges.
But then you have to make them public again.
This script will do the job for you.

## Install

I will include ubuntu installation instructions. If you use something else and you can't install let me know

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
sudo pip3 install selenium
python3 cw.py
```

Then you will be asked for username and password.
